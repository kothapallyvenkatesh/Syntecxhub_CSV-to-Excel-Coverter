# Syntecxhub_CSV-to-Excel-Coverter
 This project is a Python-based utility that reads CSV files, cleans and normalizes the data, and exports it into Excel (.xlsx) format using the pandas and openpyxl libraries. The script handles missing values, performs basic data preparation, and automates CSV-to-Excel conversion, making it useful for reporting and data preprocessing tasks.
